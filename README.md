# HarmonicAnalysis
Python code to do harmonic analysis of arbitrary molecules

This Harmonic Analysis code generates a Hessian Matrix, Mass-weights it, and then diagonalizes it to obtain squares of
harmonic frequencies and mass-weighted eigenvectors (vibrational normal modes).

What this code requires:
-A function that takes in coordinates and gives you energies.
-A geometry upon which to perform the harmonic analysis.
